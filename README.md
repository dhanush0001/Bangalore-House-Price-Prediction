# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
Aim: The aim of the project is to build a machine Learning model which is used to determine the approximate price for the houses based on several features.
Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplolib, SeaBorn, and Sklearn.
The algorithms used were Linear regression, Decision tree regressor and Random
Forest regressor.
Steps Performed: Performed exploratory data analysis, Feature Engineering and
built an Linear regression model and using Gridsearchcv built several
models(lasso, Decision tree regressor and random forest ) and finally
achieved 98â„… accuracy using random forest .
